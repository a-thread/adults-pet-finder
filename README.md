## Description

  

Adults Only Pet Finder uses Api calls to generate random pictures of cats, foxes, dogs, and goats respectively. The application uses user input to generate a description for the animal's likes, it's correct species, and weather the animal is house trained or not. There is also an educational page for users under eighteen looking to adopt a pet with resources meant to cater to that specific user.
